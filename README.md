Navigating Challenges in This Adventure
Embark on a learning journey filled with two distinct types of exciting challenges, each meticulously crafted to equip you with real-world web development skills.

## Varieties of Challenges

Code Evolution Missions: Dive into the world of starter code housed in a mystical 'Develop' folder, and transform it to meet the challenge at hand. These missions align with the odd-numbered modules.

### Pro Tip: When embarking on these missions, directly transfer the magical code contents from the 'Develop' folder to your treasure chest (repository), leaving the folder behind.
Creative Coding Quests: These challenges call upon you to summon your coding prowess and create marvelous solutions from thin air, as no starter spells (code) are provided. Even-numbered modules are your battlefield here.

## Decoding the Challenge Blueprint

Our challenges are woven with the essence of agile project management, a secret weapon used by many developer guilds. This practice is your training ground for becoming a full-stack web wizard.

### Learn More:
Explore the ancient scrolls on agile software development to deepen your understanding.

## Each challenge encompasses:

### Hero’s Request: A short and sweet tale from someone in need, outlining their desires in a magical format: AS AN / I WANT / SO THAT. For instance, "AS A wandering merchant, I WANT a magical cart to hold my goods, SO THAT my customers can purchase them."

### Quest Conditions: These are the sacred scrolls that outline the minimal requirements to deem your quest successful. Think of it as a treasure map guiding your journey.

### Visionary Glimpse: Behold a visual prophecy (image or animation) that shows the potential future—what the web application will look like once your quest is complete.

### Treasure Submission: Present your completed quest for the council (your instructional staff) to review. They will ensure that you have met all the quest conditions and provide feedback on your journey.

## Your Epic Quest for This Week:
As we tread through an odd-numbered week, you are called upon for a Code Evolution Mission. Your task is to enhance the accessibility of an ancient site for a renowned marketing guild.

### Essential Reminder: Follow the ancient Scout Law—leave the code more enchanted than you found it.
Accessibility in the digital realm ensures that all, including those with unique abilities, can experience and interact with your creations. Improving accessibility not only fulfills a noble cause but also enhances your creation’s visibility in the mystical realms of search engines.

Your tech mentor has prepared a list of specific accessibility enchantments for this quest, detailed in the Quest Conditions.

Strive to not just meet, but exceed expectations, leaving a legacy of code that stands the test of time.

Are You Ready, Brave Coder? Here’s Your Quest:
Hero’s Request:
AS A guild of marketers,
I WANT our digital abode to follow the sacred accessibility scrolls,
SO THAT our presence is felt far and wide in the realms of search engines.

Quest Conditions:
GIVEN our digital realm aligns with the accessibility scrolls,

WHEN I peruse the source code, THEN I seek the presence of semantic HTML elements.
WHEN I observe the HTML structure, THEN it should reveal a logical and mystical order.
WHEN I gaze upon the icons and images, THEN accessible alt texts should be their companions.
WHEN I scrutinize the heading elements, THEN they should descend in a harmonious sequence.
WHEN I seek the title element, THEN a concise and enlightening title should reveal itself.
Visionary Glimpse:
The Horiseon realm will reveal a navigation bar, a majestic header image, and cards adorned with texts and images at its base. Beware, young coder, this vision is optimized for the wise old desktop, and elements might shift in smaller crystal balls (screens smaller than 768px).

Commencing Your Quest:
Forge a new repository in your GitHub sanctum and clone it to your local dominion.
When your creation is ready to see the light of the world, use the sacred git commands: add, commit, and push, to update your GitHub repository.
In your GitHub sanctum, navigate to Settings > Pages, choose the main branch, and click Save to unveil your creation to the world.
Visit <your-github-username.github.io/your-repository-name> to witness your live creation.
Patience, Young Coder: The GitHub spirits might take a few moments to weave their magic. Ensure all paths in your creation are relative, and you adhere to the sacred case sensitivity of GitHub.

Quest Grading Scrolls:
Your quest will be evaluated based on:

Technical Quest Conditions (40%): Fulfilling all and above the listed conditions and code enhancements.
Deployment of the Realm (32%): Your creation's live URL, error-free unveiling, and repository housing the application code.
Quality of the Creation (15%): Your creation’s resemblance to the Visionary Glimpse (at least 90%).
Sanctity of the Repository (13%): Unique repository name, adherence to best practices, and a repository filled with wisdom and descriptive commit messages.
Quest Review:
Submit the following for the council’s review:

URL of your live creation.
URL of your GitHub repository, ensuring it bears a unique name and a scroll (README) describing your quest.
